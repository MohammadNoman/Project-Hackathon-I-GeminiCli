# Chapter 2: Robot Kinematics

This chapter delves into the fundamental principles of robot kinematics, which describes the motion of robotic manipulators without considering the forces that cause the motion.

## Forward Kinematics

Forward kinematics is the process of calculating the position and orientation of the end-effector (the "hand" of the robot) given the joint angles of the robot.

## Inverse Kinematics

Inverse kinematics, conversely, is the process of calculating the joint angles required to achieve a desired position and orientation of the end-effector. This is a more complex problem and often involves multiple solutions or no solutions.
