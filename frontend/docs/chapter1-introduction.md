# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

This chapter provides a high-level introduction to the field of physical AI and humanoid robotics. It covers the basic concepts, historical context, and future outlook of this exciting domain.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to intelligent systems that interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators. Unlike purely software-based AI, physical AI embodies intelligence in a physical form, allowing it to perform tasks in real-world environments.

## Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robots are a significant part of physical AI, designed to mimic human form and often human behavior. They are envisioned to work alongside humans in various applications, from assistance and exploration to manufacturing.
