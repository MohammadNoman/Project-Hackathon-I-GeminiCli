$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/setup-plan.ps1 -Json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).

3. **Execute plan workflow**: Generate a detailed `plan.md` artifact by meticulously following the `IMPL_PLAN` template and incorporating insights from `FEATURE_SPEC` and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Ensure the plan addresses the following:
   - **Summary**: Concise overview of the feature and technical approach.
   - **Technical Context**:
     - Fill all subsections, marking any remaining unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" (to be resolved in Phase 0 Research).
     - Explicitly detail Language/Version, Primary Dependencies, Storage, Testing, Target Platform, Project Type, Performance Goals, Constraints, and Scale/Scope.
     - **Add specific details for deployment strategy (frontend & backend, including CI/CD overview).**
     - **Incorporate initial thoughts on security considerations (API key management, data protection, input validation).**
     - **Outline a strategy for error handling, logging, and monitoring (observability).**
     - **Address scalability considerations for key components (FastAPI, Qdrant, Neon).**
     - **Briefly mention alternatives considered for major architectural choices and their rationale.**
     - **Describe the content management workflow, integrating AI tools for Docusaurus content.**
   - **Constitution Check**: Fill this section by explicitly referencing relevant principles and requirements from the constitution and how the plan adheres to them. Evaluate adherence as a gate.
   - **Project Structure**: Define the final project directory layout for source code and documentation.
   - **Complexity Tracking**: Fill if any constitution violations are justified.
   - Phase 0: Generate `research.md` to resolve all "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" items from Technical Context.
   - Phase 1: Generate `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`.
   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script.
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design.

4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```text
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Agent context update**:
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType gemini`
   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use
   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file
   - Add only new technology from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications

---

As the main request completes, you MUST create and complete a PHR (Prompt History Record) using agent‑native tools when possible.

1) Determine Stage
   - Stage: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate Title and Determine Routing:
   - Generate Title: 3–7 words (slug for filename)
   - Route is automatically determined by stage:
     - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
     - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc)
     - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Create and Fill PHR (Shell first; fallback agent‑native)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Open the file and fill remaining placeholders (YAML + body), embedding full PROMPT_TEXT (verbatim) and concise RESPONSE_TEXT.
   - If the script fails:
     - Read `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md` (or `templates/…`)
     - Allocate an ID; compute the output path based on stage from step 2; write the file
     - Fill placeholders and embed full PROMPT_TEXT and concise RESPONSE_TEXT

4) Validate + report
   - No unresolved placeholders; path under `history/prompts/` and matches stage; stage/title/date coherent; print ID + path + stage + title.
   - On failure: warn, don't block. Skip only for `/sp.phr`.
